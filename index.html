    <h3>Athletics</h3>
    <p>I've been in basketball for about 4 years. In 2018 my team and I took league championships, 
        then we went to CIFLACS Division IV and got runner-ups. This year my team and I will strive to get first place.

    <h4>Education</h4>
    <p>Growing-up in Mid-City has definitely pushed me, getting involved in and out of 
    school, finding opportunities that will help me be successful. </p>
